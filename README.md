saamwerk (collaborate in Africaans) is a collection of resources that should
help facilitate the collaboration on open-source projects. As of now, the 
only resource is "labelling-strategy", which describes how labels for issues
of open-source projects can be managed.

Feel free to open an issue on potential extensions of saamwerk.
